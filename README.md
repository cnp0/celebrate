This project is under development.

Mint generative NFTs for your GitHub releases.

Bootstrapped with [solana-labs/dapp-scaffold](https://github.com/solana-labs/dapp-scaffold).

## Getting started

Add react app environment variables for client configured Github OAuth features.
```bash
export REACT_APP_GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=...
export REACT_APP_GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=...
```

Then `yarn` to set up. `yarn start` to launch :rocket:.

# How it works

1. React app `repomint-web` for the dapp frontend
2. ExpressJS server [`repomint-auth`](https://github.com/repomint/repomint-auth) for GitHub OAuth management
3. Flask app [`repomint-art`](https://github.com/repomint/repomint-art) for generative art service
4. Flask prototype [`repomint-mint`](https://github.com/repomint/repomint-auth) to manage minting

# Notes on using Redux and basic navigation

Please use useHistory() and history.push('route') to fully use SPA features and redux will persist throughout route changes, although full reload of page will restart redux store - so for full persistence, we will store some necessary values in localStorage/cookies.

# Styling

We will be using TailwindCSS, the reason behind it is that more devs are familiar with this.
In case of css specifity issues, let's use css modules or just normal scss.
